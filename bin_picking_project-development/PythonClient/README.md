# bin_picking_project
If you would like to generate the base meshes to the project, you need to open `binPicking.ttt` scene. In the scene, there are a basic table with and basket on it. 

You need to start the simulation, after if you start `main.py` with python (placed in the project's root). Watch the simulation, and you will see that 30 randomly colored shapes will appear with random position and orientation above the basket. If you continue watching the simulation they should fall into the basket after each other.
